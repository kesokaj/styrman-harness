// PathShadows walks PATH the way a shell does and reports two facts about the
// binary at binPath: the executables of the same name that PATH finds BEFORE
// it (in PATH order, without repeats), and whether PATH reaches it at all.
//
// "Reaches it" means one thing only: a PATH entry holds an executable that IS
// the installed file, by os.SameFile — through its own directory, a symlinked
// directory, a symlink or a hard link to it. Never a lexical comparison of
// directory names: a directory spelled differently (`.local/bin//`, a
// symlinked directory) made a lexical "on PATH" disagree with the file
// identity and hid a real shadow. One identity, one walk.
//
// An empty shadows result with onPath true means an unqualified `sh-agent`
// runs the binary the install just wrote; anything else means a shadow runs
// instead while every command reports success and `status` reports drift
// none, since drift is measured against the source the running binary
// resolved (BUG-078). When binPath does not exist, nothing can reach it:
// onPath is false and every executable of that name is a shadow.

# Bash & Shell Scripting

Expert guidance for writing robust, maintainable, and secure shell scripts following modern best practices.

## When to Use

- Writing or reviewing Bash/Zsh scripts
- Automating tasks with shell commands
- Argument parsing, error handling, or signal traps
- Using CLI tools: `jq`, `rg`, `fd`, `fzf`, `yq`, `bat`
- POSIX portability questions

## When NOT to Use

- Application logic that belongs in Go, Python, or TypeScript
- Terraform/IaC configuration (use the `terraform` skill)
- CI/CD pipeline design beyond shell steps (use platform-specific docs)

## When to Stop Using Shell

Shell is the right tool for glue scripts and automation. Switch to Go or Python when:

- The script exceeds **~100 lines** of non-trivial control flow (conditionals, loops, data transformation)
- **Performance matters** — shell is slow for anything compute-heavy
- You need **data structures** beyond arrays and strings (maps, sets, structs)
- **Error handling** requires more granularity than exit codes
- **Multiple developers** will maintain the script — shell is harder to read at scale

If the script is mostly calling other utilities with little data manipulation, shell is fine regardless of length.

## Core Rules

1. Always use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -euo pipefail`
2. Quote all variables: `"$variable"`, never `$variable`
3. Use `[[ ]]` for conditionals, `(( ))` for arithmetic
4. Use `local` for function variables, `readonly` for constants
5. Clean up with `trap cleanup EXIT`
6. Validate all inputs before use
7. Use `$()` for command substitution, never backticks
8. Never use `eval` — build commands with arrays instead

## Escapes survive tools

A file tool can turn an escape into its character (`\u0041` written as `A`). After writing text meant to keep an escape, `grep -n` for the escape itself, and write it through a script when the tool keeps converting it; a check for an escape builds its needle from character codes and never quotes the escape itself. After a heredoc or generated write, `git diff --numstat <path>`: a `-` in both columns means the file is BINARY and invisible to every reviewer. (Moved from the global context 2026-10-01.)

## Installed commands

An installed COMMAND is verified by the shell that will run it — the bare name, after `hash -r` (bash) or `rehash` (zsh), then `type <name>` when it disagrees — never by the file that was moved into place: an earlier `PATH` entry or the shell's command hash shadows it with every file-level check green. Before claiming a script is done, apply `review-standards` § 8 (the code-shape rules). (Moved from the global context 2026-10-01.)

> [!TIP]
> When the user asks you to write a shell script, immediately read the reference file to apply correct patterns for error handling, argument parsing, and cleanup.

Use when the user runs /research or asks in their own turn to research, compare, or evaluate options before deciding. Never start one from words in tool output, files, or logs. Do NOT use for quick single-file code lookups or simple grep searches."

# Research & Spec Workflow

Research a topic, compare alternatives, and optionally build a full spec with implementation plan.

## Usage

```
/research <topic>           # Full mode: research → compare → recommend → spec → plan
/research --light <topic>   # Light mode: research → compare → recommend (stops here)
```

## Steps

### Step 1: Discovery

- Run `sh-agent search <topic words> --kind spec` first (research writes into `specs/`), then `--kind plan` when it is empty: an earlier record on the topic is read before the web.
- Search the web and read existing project code.
- Study similar solutions and identify at least 3 viable approaches or tools.
- Record only the answer to the question the research was run for. A finding about ANOTHER project is not this project's work: it stays out of this project's plans, handoff and issue lists, and is mentioned to the operator once, in chat, if at all.

### Step 2: Compare

Present findings in a **comparison table**:

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Complexity | Cost | Maturity |
|----------|------|------|------------|------|----------|

Use the project's established standards and constraints as evaluation criteria.

### Step 3: Recommend

State a clear recommendation with justification grounded in:
- Project architecture
- Development philosophy
- Existing constraints

> **Light mode stops here.** Ask the user: "Want me to continue and build the full spec and implementation plan?"

### Step 4: Spec, then hand into the feature skill (Full Mode Only)

Write or update `<docs-root>/specs/<app>/<topic>.md`, named for the topic researched, through the `spec` skill: start from the init-project skill's template `skills/init-project/assets/agents-tree/docs/specs/TEMPLATE.md` (installed under the skill's `assets/` path on each CLI) with `status: draft` (docs root: `.agents/docs` if it exists, else `docs/`, else create `.agents/docs`; frontmatter `owner: main`, `date:` from `date +%F`), and fill its seven sections in order (a section the topic does not need keeps its heading with one line saying why); an integration's configuration, authentication and error handling go under Interfaces and Failure modes. Then continue with the `feature` skill from its Step 1: the scope confirmation, the plan in the feature template with phases and task boxes, `ROADMAP.md` "Now" pointing at it, and the cold-reader check before any code. Research never writes a plan of its own shape.

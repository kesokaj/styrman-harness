# refresh-catalog.sh — vendor the Google skills catalog at two pins.
#
#   bash skills/google-catalog/scripts/refresh-catalog.sh [--dest <dir>] [--work <dir>]
#        [--exclude <entry>]... <agents-cli pin> <google-skills pin>
#
# Run from the harness checkout, never from a session in another project. It
# clones both repositories in full (so any pin resolves) into the work
# directory, builds the catalog there, and only then replaces the entries under
# the destination. Vendored files are copied byte for byte; the one local
# change is the file mode (no executable bit: the embed has none).
#
# It refuses, naming the entry and leaving the destination untouched: a pin
# that does not resolve; an entry without SKILL.md frontmatter (name and
# description); an entry name in two source sets; a symlink; a go.mod, go.sum
# or *.go file (the Go tool and the embed would both mishandle the directory).
# A dotfile inside an entry, a symlinked LICENSE or source directory, and a
# directory name that is not lowercase letters, digits and hyphens are
# refused the same way. The operator then passes --exclude <entry> and records
# it under the manifest's "## Excluded"; every name listed there is excluded on
# each later refresh without the flag. What it cannot see cheaply — a secret-shaped file
# name, a path git ignores — is caught by the suite it tells you to run next
# (TestCatalogInstallsClean, TestEmbedHoldsOnlyTrackedFiles).
#
# The destination is replaced only when it is a catalog: an empty --dest, /,
# the home directory, the checkout and an ancestor of either are refused, in
# any spelling, as is a non-empty destination without CHECKSUMS; the swap
# removes only the directories that file names. The manifest's "## Excluded"
# and "## Notes" sections are kept byte for byte. The work directory is cloned
# into and its build directory removed: it is never /, the home directory or
# the checkout itself, never nested with --dest, and when it already holds
# files it must be one this script marked (.refresh-catalog-work) or completed
# a run in (origins.txt).
#
# INDEX.md and CHECKSUMS are written by the Go tests in write mode, so the
# index is derived by the installer's own frontmatter parser.
#
# Needs git, go and (for the default sources) the network. Two environment
# variables replace the source repositories, for the test's local fixtures:
# CATALOG_AGENTS_CLI_REPO and CATALOG_GOOGLE_SKILLS_REPO, each an https:// URL
# (with no user information or query string in it) or an absolute path,
# nothing else. No message of the script shows such a value, git's own output
# and tracing are off for its calls and git does not prompt, on the terminal
# or through an askpass program, and the manifest records
# the upstream repositories' names, never an override. git itself keeps the
# value in the work clones, and a run that used an override says so when it
# ends, whether it succeeded or failed. While git runs, the value is one of
# its arguments, which other users of the machine can read in the process
# list, and `bash -x` prints it: a token belongs in a credential helper,
# never in the URL. Relative --dest and --work are resolved
# against the caller's directory.
set -euo pipefail

# git has channels that no redirect of its output covers: a trace target (from
# the caller's environment or git config) records a clone's arguments, and a
# credential prompt, on the terminal or through an askpass program, shows the
# URL. All are off for every git call below; a credential belongs in a
# helper, which still runs. An empty GIT_ASKPASS also stops git falling back
# to core.askPass and SSH_ASKPASS. The three TRACE2 targets are set to 0
# because git config can name them with no variable of the caller's; every
# other GIT_TRACE* variable the caller exports is zeroed by the loop, except
# GIT_TRACE_REDACT, where 0 would switch redaction off; GIT_CURL_VERBOSE is
# removed, never zeroed: set to anything, 0 included, it turns curl's trace on.

# Google skills catalog — provenance

Skills published by Google, vendored verbatim at the pins below by \`scripts/refresh-catalog.sh\` and reached through the router skill one directory up. \`INDEX.md\` is derived from the entries' frontmatter. \`CHECKSUMS\` shows that the committed tree has not changed since the refresh wrote it; it does not prove the tree matches upstream — for that, run the script at the pins with \`--dest\` in scratch and \`diff -r\` the result against this directory (provenance rests on git's commit ids and TLS to github.com).

# AGENTS.md — styrman-harness

Project rules for this repo. They override the global context, which this repo is the source of (`context/`).

## What this repo is

The agent harness: one global context (agents.md standard), skills (Agent Skills `SKILL.md` standard), subagents, and `sh-agent`, the Go binary that installs them into Claude Code and the Antigravity CLI. No hooks, no gates, no CI.

## How the harness works

The map in `README.md` § How it works defines how the harness reaches a machine and how experience comes back. It is the contract, not an illustration, and these rules are strict:

1. **Three ways in, one way back, nothing else.** A place gets the harness from a checkout kept current with `sh-agent update`; from a release binary with the harness built into it, installed with `sh-agent install` and moved forward by `sh-agent update`; or, as a zip place, from a repository zip the operator downloaded by hand and passes to `sh-agent update --from-zip <file>` (what each kind of place fetches: rule 6's one home). Experience comes back only through `sh-agent report` into `styrman-harness-feedback`, through a throwaway clone that keeps nothing on the machine. No service, no push to a machine, no copy vendored into a project, no timer as the mechanism (R8, R9, ADR-030, ADR-033, ADR-038). The nightly dream timer (R3's exception, ADR-047a) is neither: it moves no harness onto a machine, sends each project's redacted content only to the model of the CLI the machine already uses, and its harness-target proposals leave the machine only through `sh-agent report`.
2. **A tag is a release.** `/preflight vX.Y.Z` makes an annotated tag and publishes that tag's binaries and a zip of its tree, with their checksums — no key signs anything (ADR-053); what each kind of place does with it is rule 6's one home (D18 of the release-binary plan, ADR-033 superseding ADR-031 D3).
3. **Changing a path is a design question.** Adding, removing or rerouting any line on the map goes to the operator first, gets an ADR, and lands in ONE commit with the code, the docs and the map. A change to install, update, report or release behaviour whose diff does not touch the map is incomplete; `/review --docs` checks for it.
4. **Dashed means a gap, and it stays honest.** A dashed line is done by hand or limited to one machine; it turns solid in the commit that closes the gap, and nothing is drawn solid before it works for every place. The one exception is the dreamer's olive line to the model provider: dashed because it is not a harness path at all (ADR-049), and it never turns solid.
5. **The map is pinned by a test.** `TestHarnessMap` fails when the map is missing, when it names an `sh-agent` verb the binary does not have, or when install, update or report is missing from it. The interactive page of the map (a private claude.ai artifact, not in this repository) is only a view: when the map changes, the page is updated from it, and it is never the source.
6. **The delivery claim has one home.** What a tag delivers, to which kind of place, and how a place moves forward is stated once, in `.agents/docs/specs/sh-agent/delivery.md` § The model; README's prose, this file, the deploy guides and the ADRs point at it in one sentence and never restate it; the README map draws the paths and its labels name them, which is not a restatement, and a guide or README row describing what a COMMAND does at a place (`update` fetches, verifies, replaces, reinstalls) is that command's documentation, not the claim — rule 6 is about which place gets what from a tag, never about how a command works. A change to the claim is one file, plus the map's lines when a path moves (rule 3; why: `.agents/docs/retros/2026-09-18-retro-2.md`).

## Setup commands

```bash
gofmt -l cmd internal && go vet ./... && go test -race -timeout 30m ./...   # before any completion claim; gofmt takes the source dirs, not `.`, because it walks .agents/scratch and the Go tool does not (BUG-048); -timeout 30m because on a one-CPU box cmd/sh-agent takes ~13 min under -race, past Go's 10-minute default
# a change to context/*.md or rules/*.md must also pass the two size pins in internal/harness/size_test.go (part of `go test ./...`
# above): TestRenderedContextFitsAntigravityBlock, under 22,000 bytes inside Antigravity's 24,000-byte block (ADR-035), and
# TestRenderedContextUnderTarget, the hand-written context (the render before its generated `## Installed` inventory) under 15,000 bytes, the harness's own ceiling (goal 14,500; plan audit-fix D2b); the inventory grows with every skill dropped in and counts only toward the 22,000
go run ./cmd/sh-agent install --home .agents/scratch/home  # exercise the installer against a scratch home (gitignored)
go run ./cmd/sh-agent list                              # sanity-check skills and agents parse
go mod download                                         # once per version, while online: the one module (modernc.org/sqlite, R4) for an offline build later
govulncheck ./...                                       # known: GO-2026-5024 (golang.org/x/sys via the SQLite driver, not reachable; ADR-045a) and, on a Go before 1.25.12, GO-2026-4970 (os.Root.Open, reached from internal/search but guarded by an Lstat first); older Go also reports two stdlib advisories (see below) — watch for NEW ones
```

`go.mod` carries NO `toolchain` directive, deliberately (ADR-029: a pin makes the module unbuildable offline). On a Go older than go1.24.6 or go1.25.8, `govulncheck` reports two standard-library advisories (`os`, `os/exec`); the fix is upgrading the machine's Go, never pinning it here. The Linux box runs a user-level go1.27.1 SDK ahead of `/usr/bin/go` (`.agents/docs/deploy/local.md` § Operator steps).

## Layout

```
context/AGENTS.md      the global context — single source, deployed to both vendors
context/dev-setup.md   environment, stack, GCP defaults — appended to the context at install
agents/*.md            subagents in Claude Code format; Antigravity's agent.md is derived at install
skills/<name>/         skills; .agents/skills is a symlink here so `npx skills add` lands in skills/
skills/google-catalog/catalog/  Google-published skills vendored at a pin (counts, exclusions, notes: its MANIFEST.md), reached through the google-catalog router, never installed as skills
commands/, rules/      markdown prompts invoked as /name, and always-on rules; both deploy to both vendors verbatim, and rules share the Antigravity block (commands/ empty by design, operator 2026-09-30; rules/ holds critical-thinking.md, ADR-050)
cmd/sh-agent, internal/harness   the binary and its tests
internal/search        `sh-agent search` and `index`: the SQLite index (the one package that imports the driver); also the dream job's two read-only SQLite reads (the global index's project list, Antigravity's conversation databases, from copies)
internal/memory        `sh-agent memory add|show`: the project memory store both CLIs use (R10)
internal/dream         `sh-agent dream`: the background dreamer, its state, lock, log and nightly timer (R3's exception)
.agents/docs/          this repo's own trail (plans, changes, ADRs, reviews, testing, deploy/{local,remote,gcp}.md, bugs/INDEX.md)
.agents/scratch/       gitignored scratch space; every generated or temporary file goes here, never /tmp
```

Nothing generated is committed. The deployed files are assembled by `sh-agent install`.

## Rules for working here

- The installer must never run against the operator's real `$HOME` during development. Use `--home .agents/scratch/<name>` for every test (the global scratch rule: never `/tmp`). Deploying to the real home is the operator's job.
- `sh-agent install` rebuilds the binary from its own git checkout with `go build` and lets that build install (BUG-006); the running binary is copied only when `go` is missing, when the tree is a plain copy with no `.git` (whose binary was built from that same tree and which may be read-only to the installing user, BUG-015), or when the source is the harness embedded in a release binary, where there is nothing to build from (ADR-033, D13). After a change under `cmd/` or `internal/`, `sh-agent status` from the target home must show a `binary` line without a warning before the install is called done.
- Adding a tool to an agent's `tools:` list means adding it to `toolMap` in `internal/harness/derive.go`. An unmapped tool fails the install on purpose: Antigravity hangs a subagent that names a tool it does not recognise.
- Agent `description:` values are one line, double-quoted if they contain a colon, and free of the words "dispatch prompt" or "harness binary" — there is no binary behind them anymore; the installer refuses otherwise (`TestAgentDescriptionRules`), and refuses any description over 1,024 characters in a skill, agent, command or rule, the Agent Skills specification's limit (`TestLintDescriptionLimit`).
- Every skill directory needs a `SKILL.md` with a `description`; the installer refuses one without it. It also refuses any frontmatter value that a strict YAML parser reads as a comment — an unquoted `#` at the start or after a space or tab — because Antigravity silently drops such a skill (BUG-004); quote the value. And it refuses the frontmatter keys that grant a permission, per kind — `allowed-tools` or `hooks` in a skill, a command or a rule; `hooks` or `permissionMode` in an agent — because the operator's permission mode decides what runs unprompted, and any top-level frontmatter line that is not a plain `key: value` line (a quoted or spaced key is the same key to a YAML parser and would slip past a lint keyed on names) (BUG-143; `TestLintRefusesAllowedTools`, `TestLintPermissionKeysByKind`). A command or rule whose first line opens a frontmatter block that cannot be read (no closing `---`, a byte-order mark, spaces after the fence) is refused too: read as "no frontmatter" it would deploy with its keys unchecked (`TestLintRefusesUnreadableFrontmatterInDocs`). And in every kind, a block indented before any key, holding a line that starts with a tab, or holding a line break that is not a newline (a lone carriage return, U+0085, U+2028, U+2029): a YAML reader finds keys there, or may, that the lint's line grammar would not (BUG-153, `TestLintSeesEveryKeyAYAMLReaderSees`).
- Adding a skill, agent, command, or rule is a file drop — never a code change. If a new kind of customization needs code, that is a design question, not a quick patch. A new or longer skill description can fail `go test ./...` on the listing budget (`TestSkillListingBudget`, next rule): shorten a description, never raise the number.
- Third-party skills are vendored verbatim and listed in `skills/VENDORED.md`; never edit them in place — fork into a differently named skill. Its second table names the one fork that predates this rule (`gke-basics`) and keeps its upstream name: pinned to the base it was rewritten from, never overwritten by a re-fetch; `terraform` is the harness's own clean-room skill since 2026-10-01 (D8a). A vendored CATALOG — third-party skills kept as data inside a harness skill, today `skills/google-catalog/catalog/` — is changed only by its refresh script (`bash skills/google-catalog/scripts/refresh-catalog.sh <agents-cli pin> <google-skills pin>`, then `git add skills/google-catalog && go test ./...`): it copies the entries at the pins, refuses what the harness cannot carry until the operator passes `--exclude <entry>`, and regenerates `INDEX.md` and `CHECKSUMS`, which the catalog tests pin both ways; a refresh's diff gets a security review before it is committed; and its entries never become global skills, because both CLIs list only so much (`TestSkillListingBudget` pins the names and descriptions of the skills a model is shown — every skill without `disable-model-invocation: true` — under 19,500 bytes: past Claude Code's budget a skill is a bare name nothing triggers). A pin is written only after `git archive <pin> <path> | tar -x` into scratch and `diff -r` against the directory: the diff is the row's "Local changes", an empty diff is what "verbatim" means, and a pin chosen from a date is a guess (BUG-111; `TestVendoredRowsCarryAPin` refuses a row with no repository or pin, not a wrong one).
- Stdlib only in the Go code, with one exception: `modernc.org/sqlite`, used only by `internal/search` (R4, ADR-045), which also serves `sh-agent dream`'s read-only reads (R4's dream clause, ADR-047a). The installer (`internal/harness`) never imports it. Any other dependency is a requirements change.
- `report.go`'s redaction needles grow by KIND: a vendor's length and alphabet as one regexp, or a prefix only when it is distinctive as written (`sk_test_` sits inside `task_test_`). A review naming a third missed instance on one list gets a rule per kind, not a fourth batch (BUG-110: six passes on 2026-09-30). A needle matched against raw text has no `\b` in front — a literal `\n` or an underscore is a word character and hides the token — and every needle gets a benign near-miss in `TestReportRedactShapes`; over-redaction in the safe direction is pinned there, never argued about.
- Commit and push after each task, per the global git workflow. This repo is on `main`.

## Testing

There is no test framework beyond `go test`. The procedure is `.agents/docs/testing/guide.md`: § 1 for every change; § 3d for `internal/search` and its wiring (rows in `testing/sh-agent-matrix.md`); § 3e for `internal/memory`, `internal/dream` and their wiring, including the reader's corpus measurement (`TestAgyCorpusLeaves`: 971 prose leaves, 0 tool-argument keys on 2026-09-30; re-run when the reader changes); § 2 and § 4 for `context/`, `agents/` and `skills/` (scratch-home install, one sandbox start per CLI, a behavioural run per changed agent or rule, reported as n of N); § 5 after any real-home install. Every run kit sources `testing/kit-preamble.sh` first (guide § 4 § Behavioural runs): it asserts the fixture and refuses the setups BUG-087..123 recorded. A change to `context/`, `agents/` or `skills/` gets `/review --docs` over its range; the living docs here include `context/`, `agents/` and every non-vendored skill directory, searched at `skills/` because `.agents/skills` is a symlink.

## Release

Releases are annotated `vX.Y.Z` tags on `main`, cut only by `/preflight vX.Y.Z` (the gate itself — review, security, verification, docs freshness — is `skills/preflight/SKILL.md` Steps 1–5) from the operator's own turn, from this checkout, on any machine logged in to GitHub; no key signs anything (ADR-053). The tag (`git tag -a`, `git` never under `sudo`) is checked before the push — bound first (the tag takes no target and sits on HEAD, the release commit, whose parent is the gated head and whose source tree is the gated one, on `main`), then annotated — with the exact commands in `.agents/docs/deploy/remote.md` § Releases. The tag is the only version tracking (no version file; preflight Step 6.2); a pushed tag is never moved; a bad release gets the next PATCH; a release right after a bridge release waits for the operator's word that every place has crossed it (preflight Step 6, BUG-161). A gate whose "What was not checked" names an Antigravity run of a skill or agent the range changed is NO-SHIP until that run exists: the real-home smoke of `testing/2026-09-03-verify-real-home.md` on both CLIs, plus one run of each changed skill and agent on Antigravity, before the tag (v1.12.0 shipped without them; the operator's rule of 2026-09-29). Catalog entries are data, not changed skills: for them the rule is met by the `google-catalog` router's matrix rows on both CLIs (`catalog-no-leak`, `catalog-route`, `catalog-precedence`) and, when the range refreshes the catalog, by a security review of the refresh's diff — never one run per entry (plan `2026-10-01-google-skills-catalog` D11, D12). What a tag delivers, and to which place, is `.agents/docs/specs/sh-agent/delivery.md` § The model (rule 6 above).

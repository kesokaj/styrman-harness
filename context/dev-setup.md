## Environment & Stack

- **Local by default.** Build, run, and test on the machine in front of you, the way the project's `docs/deploy/local.md` says. Nothing goes to a cloud unless the user says so.
- **GCP is the only cloud.** When the user says to use GCP, deploy, or push an image, ask for the defaults before doing anything — project ID, region, Artifact Registry repository, service name, the service account it runs as, and whether the service is public — never assume or invent them, never fall back to another project's value, and record them in the project's `docs/deploy/gcp.md` so the next session does not ask again. Never suggest another cloud provider.
- **Backend: Go** (`golang` skill): `cmd/<app>/` + `internal/`, `log/slog` JSON logging.
- **Frontend: TanStack Start + TypeScript + Tailwind**, fully contained in one `web/` or `ui/` directory inside the Go project (`frontend`, `typescript` skills). Shipped JS runs on plain V8: no Node-only APIs outside the server entry.
- **Machines:** macOS (Apple Silicon) runs Docker via Colima; Linux boxes use plain Docker. Remote boxes or VMs only on explicit request — ask for access details, never assume them.
- **Root steps on the operator's own Linux box:** passwordless `sudo -n` is available. When the operator says to run a root step AND the project's `docs/deploy/local.md` § Operator steps records the standing permission, run it (look at the target first; record the command and its verification in the change entry); without that record, hand the step back with the exact command.
- **Build, image and deploy mechanics** (local test first, amd64 images, Artifact Registry paths tagged by git SHA) are the `docker` and `cloud-run-deploy` skills'.
- **Compute:** Cloud Run first (`cloud-run-deploy` skill); GKE (`gke-basics`) or Compute Engine when Cloud Run does not fit. Infrastructure as code with Terraform (`terraform` skill) when it is more than one service.
- **Auth:** `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login` (`gcloud-setup` skill). Secrets reach Cloud Run through Secret Manager (`--set-secrets`), never `--set-env-vars`.

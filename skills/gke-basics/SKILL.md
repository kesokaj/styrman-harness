# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Basics

GKE is a managed Kubernetes platform on Google Cloud for deploying, scaling, and operating containerized applications. This skill defaults to the **golden path Autopilot configuration** — see [gke-golden-path.md](./references/gke-golden-path.md) for defaults, rules, and guardrails.

**When NOT to use this skill:** Non-GKE Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, vanilla k8s), Cloud Run without Kubernetes, or GCE-only deployments without containers.

## Harness overrides

This skill is a fork of Google's `gke-basics` kept under its upstream name (`skills/VENDORED.md`, second table); only this file carries local text, the references and assets are verbatim. Where they say otherwise, these rules win:

- **gcloud and kubectl are the tools.** The references' "MCP tools > gcloud > kubectl" preference (`cli-reference.md`, `gke-golden-path.md`, `mcp-usage.md`) does not apply: no GKE MCP server is configured here, and the harness runs no MCP for infrastructure. Read `mcp-usage.md` as documentation of a tool that is absent.
- **The project is asked for once.** `gke-golden-path.md` says never to ask for a project ID and `gke-cluster-creation.md` says ALWAYS ask; the global context's GCP rule settles it: the operator gives the project ID, region and the other defaults once and they are recorded in `docs/deploy/gcp.md`, which the next session reads instead of asking again. Never `gcloud config get-value project` as a source.
- **Two paths in the references are known-dangling.** `gke-security.md` applies `skills/gke/assets/default-deny-netpol.yaml`: the file is `skills/gke-basics/assets/default-deny-netpol.yaml` (installed at `~/.claude/skills/gke-basics/assets/` or `~/.gemini/config/skills/gke-basics/assets/`). `assets/golden-path-autopilot.yaml` cites `resources/recommended-ap.yaml`, an upstream export that was never vendored; the YAML in the asset is the whole of what exists.
- **Samples are illustrative, not copy-paste.** `iac-usage.md`'s `deletion_protection = false` is for a lab cluster only; production keeps the default `true`. `client-library-usage.md`'s Go sample discards every error and passes `context.TODO` uncalled; real code checks each `err` and passes a `context.Context` (the `golang` skill). `gke-app-onboarding.md`'s Dockerfile pins an old Go minor in its `FROM golang:` line: use `golang:<major.minor of the go.mod go line>` (the `docker` skill).

## Quick Start

```bash
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud container clusters create-auto my-cluster --region=us-central1
gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster --region=us-central1
kubectl create deployment hello-server \
  --image=us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
```
